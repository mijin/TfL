# TfL

TfL has a public API located on http://api.tfl.gov.uk/, that provides quite a lot of information about the
transport network in London. This webpage describes in detail a list of end point associated with the api.

It is a quick demo to display public transportation within a 500 meter radius from where a user is located in London using a public TfL api.
